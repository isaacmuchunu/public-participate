3. **Service Layer** (2 services)
   - `PdfProcessingService` - PDF text extraction
   - `BillClauseParsingService` - Automatic clause parsing

4. **API Infrastructure**
   - `ClauseController` with 6 endpoints
   - RESTful routes with proper authorization

5. **Documentation** (4 comprehensive documents)

## 🎯 PRD Requirements Addressed

### From [prd.md](prd.md)

✅ **Core MVP Feature (Section 3.1):**
> "Multi-Channel Citizen Portal (Web, SMS, USSD): View bill details with AI-Simplified Summary, **Key Clauses**"

**Status:** Backend complete. Clause extraction, storage, and retrieval operational.

✅ **Advanced Feature (Section 3.2):**
> "AI-Powered Bill Analysis & Simplification: A list of 'Key Clauses' that have the highest potential public impact"

**Status:** Infrastructure ready. Clause identification algorithm implemented. AI integration pending (Phase 2).

### From [user-stories.md](user-stories.md)

✅ **Citizen Story #3:**
> "As a citizen, I want to **read a bill clause by clause**, so I can understand and comment on specific sections."

**Status:** API endpoints provide hierarchical clause navigation.

✅ **Citizen Story #4:**
> "As a citizen, I want to **submit my comment or suggestion on each clause**, so my voice is captured precisely."

**Status:** Database schema supports clause-specific submissions. Submission controller update needed.

✅ **Clerk Story #5:**
> "As a Clerk, I want to **upload the bill text in a structured, clause-based format**"

**Status:** Automatic PDF parsing with `/parse` endpoint. Manual clause management available.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer Pattern
Introduced proper separation of concerns:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic
- **Models**: Define data relationships

### Hierarchical Data Structure
Bill clauses support unlimited nesting:
```
Section 5: Education Funding
  ├─ 5.1: Budget Allocation
  │   ├─ 5.1.a: Primary Education
  │   └─ 5.1.b: Secondary Education
  └─ 5.2: Implementation Timeline
```

### Analytics Separation
Clause content vs engagement metrics stored separately for:
- Easy metric recalculation
- Schema flexibility
- Performance optimization
